### Initial Analysis of Potential Bus Rapid Transit Locations in Boston, MA

#### Summary

This analysis identifies routes to pilot or implement bus rapid transit (BRT) in Boston, MA. Specifically, this analysis looks for bus routes that have low levels of reliability and high ridership. It then conducts a spatial analysis of the location of the bus route, compared to common congestion points within the city. The goal is to identify bus routes that the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) should further examine for BRT interventions.

#### Input Data

There are two input data files for this analysis, both of which come from the MBTA's open data portal. The first is **MBTA Commuter Rail, Bus, & Rapid Transit Reliability** data which can be accessed here: https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mbta-commuter-rail-bus-rapid-transit-reliability. This dataset contains the basis of the MBTA's reliability metric, separated as the on time percentage numerator and denominator.

The second is **MBTA Bus Ridership by Trip, Season, Route/Line, and Stop** which can be accessed here: https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mbta-bus-ridership-by-trip-season-route-line-and-stop. This dataset contains the average number of boardings per bus route in each direction in a given season.
